HEY!

So you're a daycare worker.

And you've gotta take care of some kids.

Lots and lots of kids!

Nice kids. Stinky kids. Violent kids.

Whatever.

KIDS!

And you've gotta keep track of every nice, stinky, violent, or whatever thing they do.

Cause the last thing you need is some parent sucking time out of your precious evening just to ask, "Did Timmy eat his apples today?"

That's what we're here for. [Slide]

TakeCare.com is the daycare worker's logging tool.

Sort kids by class. (Ooooh)!
Record their daily activity (food, naps, playtimes, etc.) (Aaaah)!
You can fill out categories once and the information appears for every kid in the class.

And when all is said and done, you can print the forms, or email them to Timmy's whiny mom ("What about the carrots?!?")

TakeCare. Care for what matters.

USE IT!
